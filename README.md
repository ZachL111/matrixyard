# matrixyard

`matrixyard` is a focused C++ codebase around assemble sparse matrices and validate multiplication fixtures. It is meant to be easy to inspect, run, and extend without a hosted service.

## Matrixyard Walkthrough

I would read the project from the outside in: command, fixture, model, then roadmap. That keeps the algorithms idea grounded in files that can be checked locally.

## Capabilities

- Includes extended examples for golden cases, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents boundary checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Reason For The Project

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Where Things Live

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## How It Is Put Together

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The C++ project uses a small library boundary and a compiled assertion harness.

## Command Examples

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Data Notes

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `surge` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## Check The Work

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Tradeoffs

The repository favors determinism over breadth. It does not pull live data, keep secrets, or depend on network access for verification.

## Possible Extensions

- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add one more algorithms fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Getting It Running

Install C++ and run the commands from the repository root. The project does not need credentials or a hosted service.
